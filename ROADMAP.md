# rsky Roadmap to v1.0.0

Welcome to the official roadmap for the `rsky` project, a full-featured implementation of the AT Protocol in Rust, developed by [Blacksky Algorithms](https://blackskyweb.xyz). Our goal is to reach a stable, production-ready v1.0.0 release within the next year.

This document outlines the major milestones and components required to achieve that goal. Contributions, feature requests, and PRs aligned with these priorities are highly encouraged.

## Core Components and Priorities

### rsky-pds
A robust and reliable Personal Data Server is the foundation of the project.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] **Stability & Testing:**
  - Extensive stress testing to validate data integrity
  - Ensure no repo corruption under realistic production loads
- [ ] **Blob Storage Support:**
  - Support for multiple S3-compatible backends (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean)
  - Reliable on-disk blob and repo storage fallback option
- [ ] **OAuth & Authentication:**
  - Implement server-side OAuth flows including DPoP
  - Integrate support for scoped auth and private state (as finalized by Bluesky)
- [ ] **User-Facing Web Pages:**
  - Simple OAuth approval pages
  - Generic user signup and account management UI served directly by the PDS
- [ ] **Future-Proofing:**
  - Evaluate role of PDS in potential E2EE chat workflows

---

### rsky-relay
A high-throughput relay service that ingests and republishes AT Protocol data across the network.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] **New Crates:**
  - `rsky-carstore`: Efficient storage and indexing of CAR files
- [ ] **Relay Design:**
  - Support full-network ingestion at high bandwidth
  - Prioritize performance, scalability, and observability

---
### rsky-jetstream
Jetstream is a streaming service that consumes the AT Protocol firehose (`com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos`) and converts the CBOR-encoded MST blocks into lightweight, developer-friendly JSON.

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Implement a Jetstream-compatible service that:
  - Subscribes to the full firehose stream
  - Parses and decodes CBOR-encoded data structures (including MST blocks)
  - Outputs clean JSON events for easy use in downstream tooling

---

### App-View Layer

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Implement or integrate an **App-View** (e.g., Cypher or custom)
- [ ] Contribute to network resilience via specialized services:
  - Backlink aggregation (e.g., total number of non-deleted likes, reposts, quotes)
  - CDN or media service for blob caching and transcoding

---

### Documentation

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Comprehensive READMEs for each crate
- [ ] Developer guides and architecture references at [docs.blackskyweb.xyz](https://docs.blackskyweb.xyz)
- [ ] Tutorials, examples, and API documentation

---

### Production Readiness

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Improved dependency management across rsky workspace members through dependabot, [cargo machete](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete), version management, etc.
- [ ] Adding telemetry in the services mentioned above to yield observability
- [ ] Incorporating [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/) principles that will allow rsky users to build scalable, maintainable ATProto services that follow modern cloud-native best practices.

## Timeline
We expect to hit v1.0.0 within **12 months** from now. Progress will be community-driven and will evolve alongside changes to the AT Protocol and the needs of Blacksky-hosted communities.
