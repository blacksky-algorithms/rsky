# Blacksky Algorithms' Contributor Guide

First, we appreciate you showing interest in contributing to the rsky project! Any form of contribution is appreciated.
In this document, we outline the different ways one can contribute to this project.

Second, understand that all repositories in the **rsky** repository fall under two categories,
"crates", and "services". Crates are libraries hosted on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=rsky).
The repositories in the "services" section are what is being used to serve the end user.

## Getting Started
This project heavily involves the AT Protocol. There are resources attached to this
document that you can use to gain a better understanding.

At a high level, the **Authenticated Transfer Protocol** (aka AT Protocol, ATProto, atproto) is a generic, federated protocol for
building open social media appliactions. **Personal Data Servers** (or PDSs) store user data
and handle identity. **Relays** aggregate and distribute data across the network. **App Views** aggregate data from
the relays, for it to be used in feeds.

* [Bigsky, the official Bluesky Relay](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/tree/main/cmd/bigsky)
  * It can be accessed at https://relay1.us-east.bsky.network, but the popular option is to use https://bsky.network/.

## Contribution Process

To be able to submit pull requests (PRs) to this project, you must first make a fork of this project. This can be done by
going to the [project's homepage](https://github.com/blacksky-algorithms/rsky), looking in the top-right section of
the page, clicking the "Fork" button. 

Regarding pull requests, please try to avoid submitting PRs that change large parts of the codebase at once, or 
introducing new, and unneccesary dependencies. Additionally, refrain from adding new features or changing the
tooling or frameworks without prior discussion.

### Submitting a Bug Report
Before you decide that it's time to submit a bug report, be sure to investigate the issue, and thoroughly read
the documentation. Before submitting any report, please go through the checklist below to help us fix this bug
as soon as possible.
- Confirm that you are using the latest version of the project
- Make sure the issue you are experiencing isn't due to any user error. (We currently don't support build issues.)
- Check if there is an existing issue outlining the same one you are experiencing. If you do happen to find one,
consider leaving a comment with your experience.

In the report, we ask that you include the following information: 
- Any/All error logs
- The operating system, and platform you were using (E.g. Linux x86_64)
- The Rust Compiler Version (type `rustc --version` to get the version)
- If you are able to reliably reproduce this issue, how.

If your bug report is concerning a security vulnerability, we encourage you to email us at rudy@blacksky.app.

### Submitting a Feature Request
Similar to the [Bug Report](#submitting-a-bug-report) section, confirm that you are using the latest version, and that
you have read through the documentation. Additionally, make sure the idea is within the scope of the project. Ask
yourself if this feature will only be useful to the majority of users, or if there will only be a subsection of people
that will benefit. If it is the latter option, consider making an add-on library with that functionality. Finally,
the feature request has not already been suggested. If it has, be sure to add a comment or a reaction.

When creating your feature request, make it adheres to the following guidelines:
- A clear and descriptive title
- A step-by-step description of the suggestion's behavior. Use as much detail as possible.
- Describe what the current behavior is compared to what its new behavior would be if your changes were added to the
project.
- Feel free to use images, or short screen recordings to describe how your feature request would work.
- Use any existing projects to explain how they solved this issue as it can be used as inspiration.
